## Supporting Information for "Bayesian nonparametric analysis for the detection of spikes in noisy calcium imaging data"

Finite version of the Common Atom Model of Denti et al. (2020) based on the mixtures of finite mixtures of Fr端hwirth-Schnatter, Malsiner-Walli e Gr端n (2020).

Application to calcium imaging data from the Allen Brain Observatory (Allen  Institute  for  Brain  Science,  2016) for the detection of neurons' spiking activity.
